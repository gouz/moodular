Moodular
=======

Moodular is a jQuery plugin which allows to create carousel/slider very easily.
Moodular comes from the contraction of two words : mood & modular.
Mood for many reasons likes "in the mood - Glenn Miller", ...
Modular because this plugin has some modules integrated (controls & effects).
It's modular too, cause you can create your own controls & effects to perform your personal carousel.
